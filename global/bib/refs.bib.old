% data was created by using the mobile simulator Siafu, which is widely used in other studies (e.g. [6], [11]). The moving range of the mobile was 4.2 km square, and the location information measured every 5 minutes for 10,000 users was used for 4 hours. Also, as a default value, the error of the position information is 200 m.
