Cleaning the references: (i) remove unused .bib and (ii) get the duplicated .bib under different names

- In Latex, uncomment `refcheck` in `global/packages.tex`
- Run `scripts/clean_bib.sh`

## TODO

- Notes on slides:
  - Avoid saying "Quello che Ã¨"
  - Smooth augmented OLAP and related works
  - Fix conclusions with something to wrap-up what has been done
  - Fix the context in the big data slides
  - Introduce the "personal gazetteer"
- Da commenti Stefano:
  - As to vs As for (As for scalability)
- To ask:
    - (x) From OLTP, to OLAP, to OLAM, to Expert Systems ?? What are expert systems?
        - Data           -> Operational database, OLTP
        - Information    -> DW, OLAP
        - Knowledge      -> (Pattern base) Machine learning, Data mining, OLAM
        - Expert systems -> E' un termine vecchio e in disuso, meglio usare "Decisions and Actions"
    - (x) A-BI and not A-OLAP, although the title is now "Augmented OLAP"
    - (x) Togliere la sezione per il size "k" da describe
- Title: Knowledge pyramid
    - (x) "Preamble" --> "The knowledge pyramid"
    - (x) In base al titolo rivedere abstract
    - (x) Le due parti devono essere sinergiche
    - (x) In OLAP aggiungere riferimento a framework principale
- Conclusion
    - (x) Keep (local) conclusion in each chapter. "We implemented this .... The results are ..."
    - (x) Add conclusion at the end of each part
